        <h1 class="aboutus">About Us</h1>
        <p class="aboutusp">The Caterpillar School focuses on providing highest standards of education to ensure sound foundations for children to excel at whatever field they choose and are set for a lifetime of success.Kabeer Nadir, 25, started a school as a business but before even starting the school he realized that he had a duty toward society and must give back to the nation in his own way. Driving down the narrow, broken streets of Malir Kala board, and ending at the congested locality in Saudabad, you reach a two-storied, well-constructed building—a primary school named The Caterpillar School. It is the baby project of Nadir and his wife Fatima Azhar who started this school last year. “When we moved to a new house, this one became empty; and as it was well constructed, had huge rooms, recently been renovated, and we used to live here ourselves so I thought I should start some business to make good use of the place,” says Nadir. After living there for twenty-four years, now they have moved to a gated society.Nadir is the oldest of four brothers and has been responsible for taking care of the family business of marble supply. “The shop from where we work is on the ground floor of the same premises; it’s a commercial place so the business mindset was there. I didn’t need much help, but I still met a consultant to take help in terms of setting up a school.Providing education and not turning anyone away is the rule, but it is not easy to manage quality standards with less revenue. Nadir, not compromising on the standard of education, has hired teachers who are graduate or are enrolled in honour courses. “Many schools nearby are paying teachers an average of Rs 3,000 salary, so just imagine the level of education they are providing. But our idea was totally different; we are paying handsome amounts to teachers so that they pay attention. We only hire graduate level teachers so that they have knowledge of subjects they are teaching and are not just there to pass time. That is how most schools that are open in every nook and corner operate,” he says.</p>
